                        This is a demo of a Wiki clone website that I built using Javascript, Bulma,
                        and Next.js. The original purpose of the website was to be a Wikipedia-like
                        website for my group of friends where we documented our members and all of
                        the events/hangouts/parties that have happened over the years. Due to
                        privacy concerns, that site is private so I created this demo site and
                        filled it with randomly generated fake/placeholder data using Faker. The
                        general theme is akin to a TV show where there are main characters, side
                        characters, seasons, and events. You can use the search bar in the top menu
                        to look for pages as well.

                    <p>
                        The site leverages <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> and makes use
                        of a mix of{" "}
                        <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components">
                            server side React components and client side components
                        </a>{" "}
                        to provide a fast and crisp browsing experience that is superior to other
                        Wiki like sites like Fandom. All of the content is dynamically generated
                        from data files (i.e. data-driven) and rendered server side, which means
                        that each page is not hardcoded individually. The website is also fully
                        responsive and can be viewed comfortably on both desktop and mobile devices.
